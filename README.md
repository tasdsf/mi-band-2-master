IoT system for the Aging Population Health Care Support

Current and emerging technologies, allied to IoT, can improve the quality of life of the elderly and their health care. This type of applications aimed at the elderly, at people with health restrictions or the general population, are increasingly a concern and a target for research around the world. The possible geriatric applications currently available are already themselves an asset in the monitoring of well-being, health, physical activity and security monitoring. These radically reduce various problems in older people, increasing their independence and preventing emergencies that can save lives through prevention, even the simplest, especially in cases of dementia and heart problems. The aim here is to demystify the possible and still existing obstacles, giving a practical example, simple and low cost, taking into account the different specificities and restrictions of the target age group.

Here is the first version of the application that is part of the system in my dissertation with the name in the title. The application connects a MiBand2 to a UbiDots service with two variables. You can alert SMS messages if your heart rate is outside the specified range.
